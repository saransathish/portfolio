            <p class="topic"></p>
            <p class="con"> &nbsp;Security breaches and data breaches are common nowadays, It does not matter how strong your company's control is, the adversary somehow will find a way to get into your secured environment and compromise your security and data. Ideally, there is no blend of defenses that are 100% immune to action from a trained and determined attacker. The terrifying fact is that 60 percent of modest firms leave the business within six months of a security breach due to financial and reputational costs.

                So, let's talk more about these security and data breaches in this article to purely understand how these things are spreading and functioning in this digital ecosystem. </p>
            <p class="topic">What is a Security Breach/Security Incident?</p>
            <p class="con">The term "security breach" is any condition, event, or situation that leads or results in any unauthorized access by an attacker to computer data, applications, networks, or devices. It results in data being accessed without authorization by an attacker. Commonly, it occurs when an intruder can circumvent security mechanisms. </p>
            <p class="topic">Is a Security Breach also a Data Breach?</p>
            <p class="con">There is a difference between a security breach and a data breach. The “what is a security breach” can be answered as, a“effectively a break-in", on the other hand, “what is data breach” can be defined as an attacker getting away with your data, and if you also ask “what is a data leak” then it is the same as data breach. Visualizing a situation where a burglar climbs through the window is a security breach, and the data breach is when he enters your premises and steals your important things like a laptop and takes it away. </p>
            <p class="con">Confidential data has enormous value. It can be sold on the dark web like your names, debit cards, and credit card numbers can be bought, and then used for identity stealing or fraud. Security breach cost companies' huge amounts of money and this is very shocking. On average, the bill is nearly $4m for major companies. </p>
            <p class="topic">How Does a Data Breach Happen?</p>
            <p class="con">A data breach is a cyber security incident examples that results in sensitive data being exposed to an individual not authorized to access it. </p>
            <p class="con">It can be said that it is a result of an accidental event or deliberate action to steal information from an individual or organization. For example, an employee could accidentally uncover sensitive data, or they could intentionally steal company data and share it with a third party.</p>
            <p class="con">A data breach can be caused by an outside attacker, whose target is to obtain a specific type of data. An attacker also targets people within the organization. Hackers select specific individuals with targeted cybersecurity attacks. </p>
            <p class="topic">Types Of Data Breaches</p>
            <p class="con">In the past years, we’ve seen thousands of attacks that have breached the privacy of millions of people. From hacks that have affected college and their students and many more to breaches that have compromised data at hospitals, the list truly is limitless. </p>
            <p class="subtop">1. Hacking Intrusions</p>
            <p class="con">Hacking Intrusion contains a diversity of techniques used by cybercriminals or attackers to access and gain secure data, such as Phishing scams ,Brute force access attempts ,Ransomware,  
               and various forms of viruses/malware that cause the data breach or helped the attacker to do the data breach. </p>
            <p class="subtop">2. Insider Threat</p>
            <p class="con">One of the greatest security threats that companies face is employee error and intentional error that cause or create a reason to cause the data breach. To earn a profit, an employee uses his/her skill and knowledge of security controls to access and compromise data. It is shocking to hear that 90% of data breaches pertained to a human element. This involves incidents in which employees either disclose information directly or by creating an error that facilitates cyber criminals to access the organization’s systems. </p>
            <p class="subtop">3. Data on the Move
            </p>
            <p class="con">Laptop hard drives, backup tapes, and flash drives are all movable storage devices. They are convenient for bodily transferring data from one location to another but there is always a possibility of data being lost and if these devices get into the hands of bad guys, then they can retrieve the data and cause the breach or in some instances it is also possible that the adversary itself will try to steal those devices that carry data and that’s what we talk in next point which is physical theft.</p>
            <p class="subtop">4. Physical Theft</p>
            <p class="con">Most companies keep their IT networks secure behind firewalls and cybersecurity software. Which is necessary as well. But what if they must also face the situation where an employee leaves the organization with a laptop filled with proprietary and essential data? The threat attains access to a secure location and then downloads data and carries it into a movable drive. Therefore, organisation should protect their network. </p>
            <p class="subtop">5. Human Error</p>
            <p class="con">Unfortunately, negligence sometimes happens. It tends to happen quite often When it's about cybersecurity and data handling. As per reports of ICO, roughly 90% of the country’s data breaches in 2019 were due to human error. As there is difference in human and in machine. </p>
            <p class="subtop">6. Accidental Internet Exposure</p>
            <p class="con">A number of companies believe that by disclosing data to the public at large that is on the internet the chances of risk or unauthorized access substantially increase. 
                Initially when information/data was kept or stored on-premises servers and gained access over LAN connections things were in control.             
                Cloud computing make sure that the organization should take proactive measures and protect data being accessed over the internet. </p>
            <p class="subtop">7. Unauthorized Access</p>
            <p class="con">Negligently monitored admin privileges, and an absence of user segmentation are examples of Ineffective access controls. 

                There are chances that companies may face security breaches in absence of access procedures. As a result, costly data breaches.</p>
